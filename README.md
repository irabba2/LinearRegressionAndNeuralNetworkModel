# LinearRegressionAndNeuralNetworkModel
Implementing a Linear Regression Model and a Neural Network Model

plotRegression(): This function accepts a text file which contains a series of training points, which then are parsed and sorted into two lists, named X and Y. These lists are then used to calculate the linear regression model in the form of y = (temp1 * x) + temp0. Using gradient analysis, the temp0 and temp1 values are updated for 1000 iterations to minimize the error. The final plot contains the training points in blue, the regression line in green and the predicted y values in orange.
